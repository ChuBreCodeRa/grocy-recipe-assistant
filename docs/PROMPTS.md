# Prompt Templates

This document provides the exact templates used for all AI interactions in the Grocy Recipe Assistant. These templates are carefully designed to provide consistent, structured responses that can be reliably parsed and used by the system.

## Ingredient Filtering

**Purpose**: Filter inventory items to identify valid food ingredients while preserving original names.

**Template**:
```
You are a food ingredient specialist assisting with recipe searches.
Analyze this inventory list and return ONLY a JSON array containing the original names of valid food items.

Guidelines:
- Return the EXACT original names of food items without generalizing them
- Only filter out non-food items (paper products, cleaning supplies, etc.)
- INCLUDE prepared food items like "taco dinner kit" or "pasta sauce mix" 
- INCLUDE all original ingredients even if they contain brand names or packaging details
- Do not combine or group similar items

Inventory items: {inventory_items}
```

**Output Format**: JSON array of strings
```json
["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3", ...]
```

---

## Ingredient Combinations

**Purpose**: Generate meaningful groupings of ingredients that work well together in recipes.

**Template**:
```
You are a professional chef creating recipe ingredient combinations.
Create 4-5 realistic ingredient combinations for recipes using EXACTLY these items:
{', '.join(ingredients)}

Important guidelines:
1. Use the EXACT ingredient names provided - do not generalize or rename them
2. Group ingredients that would work well together in traditional recipes
3. Each group should form the basis of a cohesive dish that makes culinary sense
4. For prepared foods like "beef stew" or "tuna helper", consider what would complement them

Examples of good groupings with exact names:
- If given "chunk light tuna in vegetable oil", "pasta", "cheese" → keep those exact names
- If given "spaghetti & meatballs in tomato sauce", pair it with "cheese" not "side dish"

Return only a JSON array of arrays with the exact ingredient names:
[["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"], ["ingredient4", "ingredient5", "ingredient6"], ...]
```

**Output Format**: JSON array of arrays
```json
[
  ["ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3"],
  ["ingredient4", "ingredient5", "ingredient6"],
  ...
]
```

## Ingredient Classification

**Purpose**: Classify recipe ingredients as Essential, Important, or Optional and determine if they're in the user's inventory.

**Template**:
```
You are a culinary assistant.
Given a recipe, classify each ingredient as:
- Essential: Defines the dish; cannot omit.
- Important: Strongly affects flavor or texture.
- Optional: Can be omitted with little impact.

Also mark whether the user has this ingredient in their inventory. You must match inventory items to recipe ingredients exactly by name or by recognizing when an inventory item contains the recipe ingredient.

Output strictly as JSON array:
[
  {
    "ingredient": "ingredient name",
    "category": "Essential | Important | Optional",
    "in_inventory": true | false,
    "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0
  },
  ...
]
Recipe: {recipe_name}
Instructions: {instructions}
Ingredients: {ingredients_list}
User Inventory: {user_inventory_list}
```

**Output Format**: JSON array of objects
```json
[
  {
    "ingredient": "ground beef",
    "category": "Essential",
    "in_inventory": true,
    "confidence": 0.9
  },
  ...
]
```

## AI Recipe Generation

**Purpose**: Generate complete recipes when Spoonacular doesn't return good matches.

**Template**:
```
You are a creative chef. Create a recipe using only ingredients from this inventory list.
        
Available ingredients: {', '.join(available_ingredients)}

{diet_instructions}
{time_constraint}
Your recipe must:
1. Only use ingredients from the available list (plus basic salt, pepper, water)
2. Include a title, cooking time, servings, ingredient list with amounts, and step-by-step instructions
3. Be practical and reasonable to make at home
4. Maximize the use of available ingredients

Return your recipe in this JSON format EXACTLY as shown, with proper JSON syntax:
{
  "id": "ai-recipe-{unique_id}",
  "title": "Recipe Name",
  "readyInMinutes": 30,
  "servings": 4,
  "image": null,
  "summary": "Brief description of the recipe",
  "extendedIngredients": [
    { "name": "ingredient1", "amount": 1, "unit": "cup" },
    { "name": "ingredient2", "amount": 2, "unit": "tablespoon" }
  ],
  "instructions": "Step-by-step cooking instructions",
  "ai_generated": true
}

IMPORTANT: Ensure your JSON is valid with proper commas between all objects in arrays and double quotes around all string values.
```

**Output Format**: JSON object
```json
{
  "id": "ai-recipe-12345",
  "title": "Tuna Pasta Bake",
  "readyInMinutes": 25,
  "servings": 4,
  "image": null,
  "summary": "A quick and easy tuna pasta bake using ingredients from your pantry.",
  "extendedIngredients": [
    { "name": "chunk light tuna in vegetable oil", "amount": 1, "unit": "can" },
    { "name": "pasta", "amount": 8, "unit": "oz" },
    { "name": "cheese", "amount": 1, "unit": "cup" }
  ],
  "instructions": "1. Cook pasta according to package directions. 2. Drain tuna. 3. Mix pasta and tuna in a baking dish. 4. Top with cheese. 5. Bake at 350°F for 15 minutes until cheese is melted.",
  "ai_generated": true
}
```

## Review Parsing

**Purpose**: Extract structured data from natural language reviews.

**Template**:
```
You are a feedback analyst for recipe reviews.
Parse the following recipe review to extract:

1. Effort level (easy, moderate, difficult)
2. Flavor descriptors (3-5 words like "savory", "spicy", "bland")
3. Overall sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
4. Any mentioned ingredients that were liked or disliked

Return ONLY a JSON object with your analysis:
{
  "effort": "easy|moderate|difficult",
  "flavors": ["flavor1", "flavor2", ...],
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "liked_ingredients": ["ingredient1", ...],
  "disliked_ingredients": ["ingredient2", ...]
}

Review text: "{review_text}"
Recipe name: "{recipe_name}"
```

**Output Format**: JSON object
```json
{
  "effort": "easy",
  "flavors": ["savory", "hearty", "satisfying"],
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "liked_ingredients": ["beef stew"],
  "disliked_ingredients": []
}
```
