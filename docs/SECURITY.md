# Security Practices

This document outlines the security considerations for the Grocy AI Recipe Assistant during both development and future production use.

**Status: Design-phase security practices defined.**

---

## 1. API Key Management

- OpenAI and Spoonacular API keys will be stored in a `.env` file and never committed to version control.
- `.env.example` will include placeholder values for safe sharing.
- Docker secrets or encrypted vaults (e.g., 1Password CLI or environment vaults) may be used in future production.

---

## 2. Environment Configuration

- The system uses a local `.env` config to store sensitive values.
- Environment files should be excluded via `.gitignore` to prevent leaks.
- Local development uses `docker-compose` for controlled environments.

---

## 3. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Redis cache minimizes unnecessary OpenAI/Spoonacular calls.
- Future versions may implement request throttling per user profile or Home Assistant trigger.

---

## 4. Data Privacy

- No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored.
- All user preferences, ratings, and profiles are local-only unless explicitly exported.
- Data is stored using PostgreSQL in local containers or optional encrypted volumes.

---

## 5. Logging and Monitoring (Planned)

- API failures (Grocy, Spoonacular, OpenAI) will be logged to structured log files.
- Cron job errors will be logged in `cron_failures.log` or equivalent error handler.

---

## 6. Admin Capabilities

- No administrative web interface is currently planned.
- All configuration is managed via local environment and file-based setup.

---

## 7. Deployment Considerations (Future)

- In a production environment, reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX) should enforce HTTPS.
- Network access to APIs should be scoped to only essential services.
- OAuth or Home Assistant token-based access may be added later if public endpoints are introduced.
